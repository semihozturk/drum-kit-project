This is Drum Kit project completed by using html, css, javascript, and DOM manipulation.

By listening keydown, and click events from user, buttons that have background images make sounds which I downloaded them in to sounds file.

You can click on buttons, or just use the letters on keyboard which you have access to by keydown method.
